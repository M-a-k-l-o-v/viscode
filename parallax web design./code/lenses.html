      <p style="margin-left: 40px">All manner of technology surrounds us today, it defines us. It is us. From our play
        stations, laptops, tablets, and phones to game-changing technology that furthers robotics, and space
        exploration, or the behind-the-scenes tech driving medicine, science, and education. Technology is here to stay,
        but it’s always morphing and expanding, with a thousand trillion percent increase in computational power in the
        last decade. As each new technology enters the scene, it has the potential to improve lives, land rockets and
        even make vaccines . But, do not be fooled- its greatest potential is its ability to dilute relations, destroy
        motivation, breed depression and worst of all, end lifes. They have ripped open our eyes to the dream of a
        manmade utopia brimming with insecurity and misplaced trust. Welcome to your dream, no, welcome to OUR dream…
      </p>


      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Social media allows people to interact in ways they could never imagine. It has
        found organ donors, long-lost families, and made best friends. There are infinite benefits to be found in the
        social media world- that is assuming it’s just a place to chat with friends, post pictures, celebrate
        graduations and socialize. Assuming people don’t have insecurities, flaws, envy, deceit, lust or greed.
        Assuming all children are mentally grown, all teens are stable and all adults aren’t racist or sexist. But we
        can’t assume that because nobody’s perfect, morally, mentally or physically. Social media has become a breeding
        ground to lies, conspiracies and insecurities. <strong><em>Whether it’s the growing generation developing
          self-esteem issues or the sudden surge in identity crisis amongst the teens.</em>></strong>> If we are not
        careful it will grow and spread like an infection until the host is dead. The role of the financial sector in
        this issue is evident, with the technology industry providing room for companies seeking revenue growth per
        quarter to prioritize usage time over usage effect. The increase in self harm of pre-teen girls from 2010 to
        2020 is up 190% and 150% for suicide, at the same time the number of social media users increased by a mere 3x.
        If you still have not recognised the correlation then here is another take; what if it was your child who
        hurt themselves just because someone one tiktok said they were fat, skinny, or their nose was too big. The issue
        here is how long we remain in the world of ‘what ifs?’ Till the next generation are scared to have face to
        face conversations? Till they can’t live a day without scaring their self image? Maybe till your four year old
        kids cry to you “why am i ugly?” Till when? We’ve created a world in which online connection has become primary,
        especially for younger generations. And yet, in that world any time two people connect, the only way
        it is possible is through a sneaky third person who’s paying to manipulate those two people; resulting in a legal
        field where companies can now compete for your attention constantly and by law, they are doing nothing wrong.
        Where it is legal for them to trade your child’s innocence and esteem for as little as ten cents. It is no surprise
        that the tech industry of the world is now worth 5 trillion dollars, after all you are in an illusion and you
        pay them -unconsciously- to keep you in it. You are not just the target market anymore, You are “the product!”

      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Some of you are probably thinking “well not everyone uses social media” but can you
        say the same for phones or tabs? Communication tech is just as big an industry, if not bigger than social. We
        have progressed so much in this industry that we are beginning to see it as an extension of ourselves. If I
        told you to grab your phones and shut them down for the rest of the day or I told you to turn off your WiFi for
        the next couple of hours. Most would have a slight shift in their facial expression-some would even feel anxious
        or concerned, this is a prime example of how we are connected to this technology. I am appalled knowing a mere
        10yrs ago you would say to your friend “lets meet at 12pm” and you would go the next day just knowing they would
        show up. Today on the other hand if someone takes even one minute to reply to our texts, we panic. Immediately
        our mind fabricates whatever meaning to this lag- ”that might be offensive, let me delete it” doesn’t that
        frighten you? While it is apparent that we can now share our life story with many more people, and travel around
        our world without the worries of abandoned relatives. Do you notice how the same tool is also being used to
        avoid the awkwardness that comes from staring into the terrible faces of our loved ones? No? That’s fine,
        after all it’s just the new way to communicate, right… Children would now sooner spend their time chatting with
        their friends in the dark rooms of a hotel than head to the pool to meet new friends. But that’s how children
        are meant to behave, right… We now spend more and more of our time on the phone or the laptop/MacBook, we begin
        to build brittle connections and half-sown relationships. But it’s all fine, isn’t it? Nah, If we would just
        drop the phone or laptop every once in a while and go outside, take a walk, if only… I am heartbroken by the
        world we live in where the green earth is seen only through the bright screens.

      <p style="margin-left: 40px">The modern-rational is a theory suggested by philosophers at the Frankfurt School,
        this theory exclaims the downward slope of morality and rationality as a result of technological growth in the
        current day, to put simply, we moderns are beginning to see the world as just a sum of resources, raw materials,
        and system components; everything has lost its inner principles. Aren’t most of our ideologies like religion and
        art, isn’t morality, the result of seeking a deeper truth in all things of life? Is it human to ponder, to
        attribute meaning to the everyday task? As tech has progressed we have become more adapted to observing a
        foreign scenario from an angle of rationalized thinking. Is a child’s smile just the movement of neurons and
        muscles? We are now seeing things arounds us as mere variables in a greater equation, where is the element of
        life in that? Are we now more like our tools than they are us? There is a simple solution suggested. the concept
        of communicative rationality which preserves culture and allows room for technological growth. But the only way
        it prevails in modern society is if there truly is a truth to be found in every day of the world, so, is there
        meaning in your teacher’s compliment or in your girlfriend’s laugh? What about your child’s birth, is there m
        eaning in that? No doubt there is a simplistic hope to be found in the rational mind, why ruin something so
        simple with the creation of that same mind? So- what stops you from accepting tech into everyday morals and
        believes to create a complementary not opposing system? What’s stopping you from being human? This issue has
        led to a socioscientific argument, “The end of the means or the means of the end?” For generations we have
        placed neutrality on technology, this has led to the idea of “it is the individual that is wrong not the gadget.”
        Reports show that this isn’t the case, a tool built to a degree of accuracy by the maker, hence the tool does
        have intended purpose. A gun is made to shoot, knowing that the target’s life will be endangered.
        A bomb is made to be destructive. In a reality where each tool’s definition of its goal is different from its
        users, there is bound to be conflict.

      <p style="margin-left: 40px"><em>Trust.</em>> We have built nations around this word, it is a founding principle of our
        civilization. Yet as important this word is, it is given, each second, to strangers thanks to the internet. How?
        When you pay your fees online to an extent you place your trust in the site that your money won’t be stolen,
        you trust your food will be delivered to you safely so give your address. This ‘shared trust’ is wonderful. The
        only thing about it is that we trust when we are told something online we sometimes tend to believe this is
        true; this has led to waves of suicide through online bullying. It allows one party to build a false identity to
        manipulate the mind of the second party. This is not a fair situation. Here’s a thought, a 46yr old man in his
        basement pretending to be a 10yr old in need of help, that same man chatting with your 12yr old kid or nephew
        about things that could endanger him or corrupt his morals and mind. This is just a small scale, imagine that it
        is compounded by the 5 billion<em>'active'</em> internet users each　with different motives and lifestyles. Good
        luck dealing with that..
      </p>


      <p style="margin-left: 40px">If this status quo persists over 20 years… we will most likely destroy our 
        civilization through willful ignorance. We will probably fail to meet the challenge of climate change and degrade 
        the world’s democracies so that they fall into some sort of bizarre autocratic dysfunction.This may result in 
        the ruin of the global economy. Technology, in itself, is but a tool made to make life more comfortable for 
        humans, but we have tarnished it, bent to do more harm than good in the depth of our endless deception, 
        delusion, and dishonesty. When does such greed end? When do we begin to see the errors in our ways? When do we 
        begin to realize there is a possibility of life devoid of greed, hate, and immorality? When shall we begin to 
        see behind new lenses? When? What’s frightening, and what hopefully is the last straw that will make us wake up 
        as a civilization to how flawed this theory has been in the first place is to see that now we are in viewing 
        distance of a world where we can only relate on a basis of war because of no trust, where a whole nation’s 
        self-esteem is degraded and dissolved into collective self-pity and loathing. Where you can no longer send your 
        children to school for fear of unimaginable immorality. A world with the very concept of communication lost in a
        depraved, religion-like idea of profit at all cost; I shiver at the thought of such a world and pray from the 
        bottom of my heart that we are freed from this chaotic way of living.
